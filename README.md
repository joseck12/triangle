## Behaviour driven development
* The program should return this when all sides are equal:

**Input**: side A = 3, side B = 3, side C = 4

**Output**: These measurements form an equilateral triangle.
* The program should return this when two sides are equal:

**Input**:side A = 4,side B = 4, side C = 5

**Output**: These measurements form an isosceles Triangle.

* The program should return this when no sides are equal:

**Input**:side A = 4, side B = 5, side C = 6

**Output**: These measurements form a scalene Triangle.
* The program should return this when the sum of any two sides is less than or equal to the third side:

**Input**:side A = 1,side B = 1, side C = 5

**Output**: These measurements cannot form a triangle.
